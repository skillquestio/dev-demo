**Bubble Developer Vetting Project**

**Overview**
We’re excited to invite skilled Bubble.io developers to join us in shaping the future of our product at [learn.skillquest.io](https://learn.skillquest.io). This project serves a dual purpose: it’s both a chance to contribute to a real product feature and an opportunity to showcase your abilities for a long-term role on our team. Our highest-priority feature is a sleek, data-rich dashboard—and we want to see how you approach it. After reviewing your creation, we aim to select 2 developers to continue forward in a full-time capacity.

**Why Join Us?** Skillquest is a fast-growing company that uses video games to teach teens how to code. You’ll be working with an experienced team (including a fellow Bubble developer) on meaningful projects that impact thousands of students. We love clean design, smart solutions, and developers who take initiative.

**What You Bring**

- Strong Bubble.io experience (please share your past work!)
- Solid understanding of Bubble's database, workflows, and responsive engine
- Front-end design sensibility — you’ll be responsible for designing the UI/UX from scratch without provided mockups
- Strong preference for developers with familiarity of JavaScript and JS frameworks (React/Vue/Next.js)
- Extra bonus if you’re comfortable with automation tools like n8n, Make.com, or have experience in AI integrations

**Non-Technical Skills We Value**

- Clear, professional written English communication
- Strong collaboration skills and responsiveness
- Self-motivation and the ability to drive a project independently
- A genuine interest in gaming and tech education — you’ll be building tools for a mission-driven company
- Comfort working in a primarily asynchronous, written communication environment

**The Trial Project**
We’ll assign a small number of selected applicants the same scoped project and provide up to **20 hours total (paid at \$15/hour)** over the course of **two weeks**. This is not necessarily indicative of long-term compensation but rather a stipend to support your time in putting your best foot forward.

This trial is designed not only to test technical ability but also to evaluate how you manage your time across a longer period. Lots of people can sprint through a build, but we’re looking for someone who can consistently deliver high-quality work, communicate well, and manage their own workflow reliably over time.

**After the first 10 hours**, there will be a review checkpoint where we’ll assess your progress and performance. Based on this initial checkpoint, **a smaller group of candidates will be selected to continue for the remaining 10 hours**. This helps us identify individuals who not only demonstrate great technical execution, but also consistency and strong communication over time.

You’ll be given a dedicated Bubble environment which is similar to a portion of our production app and includes data models for:

- Users
- Leads
- Video watch time records
- Campaigns

**Your Task**
Build a clean and functional analytics dashboard that:

- Displays total users, leads, and watch time
- Allows filtering on different fields and dates
- Shows time-based trends (weekly/monthly)

**What We’re Looking For**

- A structured, maintainable Bubble setup
- Intuitive and responsive UI/UX
- Accurate data display and functional filtering

**How It Works**

1. **Apply**: Submit your interest through Upwork between **Wednesday, April 23 and Monday, April 28**. Not all applicants will be selected to complete the test project.
2. **Build**: Selected applicants will receive a project brief and access to their Bubble environment.
3. **Checkpoint**: After 10 hours of work, participants will be reviewed. Only top candidates will be invited to complete the final 10 hours.
4. **Submit**: Share your finished project by transferring ownership or inviting us as collaborators.
5. **Review**: Our internal team will score your work using a rubric.
6. **Offer**: If you impress us, we’ll invite you to join us for future paid work and product development.

**Timeline**

- **April 23–28**: Applications accepted
- April 29–May 5: First 10 hours of the trial project
- May 6–12: Selected candidates continue final 10 hours
- May 13–15: Skillquest reviews submissions
- On/before May 19: Long-term candidate hired

**Ready to Show Us What You’ve Got?**
This is a great opportunity to demonstrate your skills on a real product while earning paid project time. We're looking forward to seeing what you create.
